HTML is a Markup language that is used to design web pages and JavaScript is a programming language that enables dynamic interactivity
on websites when it is applied to an HTML. It helps the users to build modern web applications. But the problem with this JavaScript
was designed to run in a single-threaded environment, so multiple scripts cannot run at the same time and also when executing 
Javascript scripts on an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished. So, To overcome this Web worker comes 
into the picture. The Web Workers is a separate piece of JavaScript code that runs in the background of the web page without affecting it.

What is Web Worker?

Web workers are multithreaded object which is used to execute Javascripts in the background without affecting the performance of the 
application or webpage. Web Workers allow for long-running scripts that are not interrupted by scripts that respond to clicks or other 
user interactions and allow long tasks to be executed without affecting the responsiveness of the web page. Generally, it is used for 
big CPU intensive tasks.
