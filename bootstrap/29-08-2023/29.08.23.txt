Application cache: 

A web application is cached and accessible without internet connection. Now we can offline web applications that will run without 
internet connection by just creating a manifest in our application.


Appcache file has three sections:
CACHE MANIFEST: Files under this header will be cached after they are downloaded for the first time.
NETWORK: Files under this header require a internet connection, will never be cached.
FALLBACK: Files under this header specifies fallback pages if a page is inaccessible.

*.appcache
CACHE MANIFEST:
/theme.css
/logo.png
/index.html

NETWORK:
login.js

FALLBACK:
/offline.html


<html manifest="digital-lync.appcache">
</html>

Benefits of using application cache:

Offline browsing: Users can use the appliction whenever they want to the app when they are offline.
Speed: When app is already cached, it is easy to access data with the greater speed, since cached resources load faster than uncached resources.
Reduced server load: Browser will download only resources which are updated.
