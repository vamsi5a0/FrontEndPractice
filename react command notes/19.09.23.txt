Routing: Routing is the process of redirecting a user to different pages based on their action or request.

In react we are going to use external library called react router to configure navigation.

For configurating react router library:

npm install react-router-dom

index.js
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

BrowserRouter keep tracks of all the user navigations either it might be forward/backward navigation.
> Internally browser router uses HTML5 browser api to keep the routing information.

    return (
        <React.StrictMode>
            <BrowserRouter>
                <App/>
            </BrowserRouter>
        </React.StrictMode>
    )

App.js

import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';


    return (
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/routeName" element={<tagName/>}></Route>
            <Route path="/routeName" element={<tagName/>}></Route>
            <Route path="/routeName" element={<tagName/>}></Route>
            <Route path="/routeName" element={<tagName/>}></Route>
        </Routes>
    )

Link: A <Link> is an element that lets the user navigate to another page by clicking or tapping on it.

Syntax:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

    <Link to="/routeName"></Link>

useNavigate: The useNavigate hook returns a function that lets you navigate programmatically

import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();

navigate('/routeName');

Sharing data between two different components.
